An app that learns user input gestures like (circle, arrow) and recognizes them when drawn again by the user

### The app:
1. Allows the user to draw a gesture
2. Stores gesture as a template
   - Templates are stored after resampling the path to a set number of points
   - Rotating points to the desired angle
   - Scaling points into a container of fixed size
   - transforming points into the center of the canvas
4. if the user draws again
   - the app applies the same transformations to the drawing as to the templates
   - calculates the closest template by calculating the distance between new drawing points and template points
   - Displays the closest template with a score of how close it is to the userâ€™s drawing.



## What I learned:
1. Reading and understanding the research paper
2. Using listeners (for mouse and keyboard input)
3. Applying abstraction by refactoring difficult and long operations into small methods


## Info:
This app is based on a research paper titled [_Gestures without libraries, toolkits or training: a $1 recognizer for user interface prototypes_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1294211.1294238) and was assigned as homework for a data structures class where I completed this assignment.

### Recognition:
_this app was an assignment at a university course_
The class instructor wrote test files.
Files were downloaded from the original repository on the class's organization and re-uploaded to my personal GitHub.

#### To use the app, Run the `GestureApp.java` file || App might require the college's graphics library and might not run on your machine
